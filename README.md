# WeatherBook ~ What's the weather today?

WeatherBook is a React-ReduxJS application that loads data from the [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) along with [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/) 

Styling Theme is based on Telus Digital Lab's Telus-Thorium Core [Telus Design System](http://tds.telus.digital).
